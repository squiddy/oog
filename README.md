Simple android app showing the front camera in full screen. I'm using this in
combination with [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) as a webcam.

Don't read this is you ever wrote an android app, I'm probably violating
*all* best practices here, but I kept it simple to understand it.
Similar example apps introduced things like fragments and navigation right away,
and I don't understand those yet.

This is also really hardcoded to work with my smartphone.
